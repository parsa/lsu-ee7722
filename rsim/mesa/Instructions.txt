This directory contains files needed to simulate the SPECcpu2000
mesa benchmark, and to view the results of simulation.

* Background

** The Mesa benchmark

See http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/CFP2000/177.mesa/docs/177.mesa.html


** The RSIML Simulator


Visit http://www.ece.lsu.edu/koppel/work/rsiml/ for some
documentation, and to check out your own copy use an svn client to
pull from https://svn.ece.lsu.edu/svn/dmk/trunk/rsiml (or a Web
browser to just view files). The README.lsu has additional
background. Note that documentation is incomplete and out of date.


** The PSE Visualization Tool

See http://www.ece.lsu.edu/ee4720/proc.html#entry9 . If this link
becomes stale, look for PSE instructions on that page.


* Contents

./r5
 Directory containing mesa source and a compiled version of mesa.

./rsim-run
 Directory containing files needed to run the simulation.


* View Simulation Results

This package includes the results of a simulation run. This
can be viewed without having to run a simulation yourself.
To view results:

 [orion.ece.lsu.edu] % pse mesa-sim-results.ds

If you run your own simulation the results will be placed
in a file named "dataset.ds" by default. To view that:

 [orion.ece.lsu.edu] % pse dataset.ds


* To Run a Simulation

 If necessary, go to rsim-run directory:

   [orion.ece.lsu.edu] % cd rsim-run

 Run simulator:

    [orion.ece.lsu.edu] % rsim -f ../r5/mesa.core -3 /dev/null -C rsim.par -n -i 4 -a 64 -m 32 -L 3 -H 16,16 -- -frames 4 -meshfile mesa.in -ppmfile mesa.ppm
    Simulation Starting


    ** Target Configuration **

    CD: Simulator Assertion Level: All Some 
 [snip]
     340.0        1 BrCoNo   _endopen+8 libc.so.1

    End of Simulation
    About to exit after time 32106930


 After a few minutes (depending on options), view simulator output:

   [orion.ece.lsu.edu] % pse dataset.ds


* Modify Configuration

To modify the simulated system change the rsim command-line arguments
or edit rsim.par.  Things that might be changed are the cache
size, number of functional units, branch predictor.
